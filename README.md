# SmoothParticleHydrodynamics

With this program you can model traffic flow behavior. The only thing that has to be done as a user is provide an input file.
The input file should consist of a particle (car) per line and should end with an empty line.
Each line has 4 values in the following order:
X position, Y position, density and initial velocity.

Example file:  
0 3.7 1 33.33  
100 3.7 1 33.33  
200 3.7 1 33.33
